# About

Grabs the latest data from UK Government Covid cases and joins it to an MSOA lookup provided by https://github.com/drkane/geo-lookups to derive the local authority and region.

Uploads resulting data to Google Sheets to provide refreshable datasource for Tableau Public. 

Works with updated CSV format released end of October.
